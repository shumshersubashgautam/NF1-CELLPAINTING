# Perform illumination correction and save corrected images

In this module, we perform illumination correction (IC) on images for each plate and save the corrected images into new folders. 
Images are saved as 16-bit depth, which is the same as the raw data.

## Run the `nf1_ic` notebook

To calculate and apply an IC function on each channel, run the [nf1_ic.ipynb](nf1_ic.ipynb) notebook as a python script using the code block below:

```bash
# Run this script in terminal
# move to the 1.cellprofiler_ic directory to access the `sh` script
cd 1.cellprofiler_ic
# run the notebook as a python script
source nf1_ic.sh
```

For four plates, it took about 2 hours to calculate, apply, and save illumination corrected images on a computer using Pop_OS! 22.04 LTS with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor.

For three plates, it took about 18 hours to calculate and save illumination corrected images on a computer using MacOS Ventura 13.2.1 with the M2 chip.
